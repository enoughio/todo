# Todo List Templating Project

This is a backend templating project where I explored and applied various technologies to implement a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a to-do list application. The project focuses on learning how to modularize code for better organization, while also giving flexibility to integrate different frontend and backend technologies.

## Project Overview

The app allows users to manage tasks through the following core operations:

- **Create**: Add new tasks to the database.
- **Read**: Fetch and display all tasks in a structured view.
- **Update**: Edit existing tasks.
- **Delete**: Remove completed tasks.

The project is built using:

- **Node.js** with **Express**: For handling backend logic and routing.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing and managing tasks.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: For templating the frontend and rendering views dynamically.
- **Modularization**: Backend logic is split into controllers, routes, and database configuration files for scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Full CRUD functionality** with a PostgreSQL database.
- **Modularized Code**: The project is structured to keep database operations, routes, and core app logic separated, improving clarity and making it easy to expand.
- **Template Rendering**: Uses EJS for rendering views, allowing for seamless frontend-backend integration.
- **Expandable Design**: This project is set up in a way that different frontend technologies (like React or Vue.js) or backend frameworks (like Nest.js) could easily be integrated or experimented with.

## Project Structure

```
- config/
   └─ dbConfig.js           # Database configuration (PostgreSQL)
- controllers/
   └─ todoController.js     # Handles all task-related operations (CRUD)
- routes/
   └─ todoRoutes.js         # Routing for task operations
- views/
   └─ index.ejs             # Frontend template using EJS
- public/
   └─ style.css             # Styles for the frontend
   └─ script.js             # Frontend logic (optional)
- index.js                  # Main server file (sets up Express server)
- README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment for building the server-side application.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for routing and handling HTTP requests.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing and managing task data.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for generating dynamic HTML content.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.

## Future Learning Opportunities

This project provides a great foundation for learning more about:

- **Frontend frameworks**: You could replace the EJS templating with React, Vue.js, or Angular for a more dynamic frontend experience.
- **Database optimization**: Experiment with different databases like MongoDB or MySQL and apply optimizations.
- **Authentication**: Add user authentication with Passport.js or JWT to learn about security.
- **Advanced Backend Concepts**: Explore microservices, web sockets, and other patterns to enhance the backend.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure PostgreSQL:
   Set up your local PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in `config/dbConfig.js`.

4. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

5. Access the app at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Conclusion

This project has been a great learning experience for me, as it allowed me to experiment with both frontend and backend technologies while focusing on modular code organization. It's a flexible base for expanding into more advanced concepts.

Feel free to clone, explore, and build on top of it!
